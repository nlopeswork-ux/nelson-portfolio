      'Investors and agents navigated the Customer Portal, a separate Agent Portal, and the Secondary Government Portal — three products, three technology stacks (Salesforce Communities Cloud, Salesforce Communities Cloud + Visual Force, and SAP BTP + BLS.NET), and three inconsistent experiences layered onto highly customised, hard-to-change architecture. The secondary portal ran on an MVC architecture that caused response delays, and customers and agents both complained about the design, the terminology, and the amount of manual back-and-forth required to get a licence.',

Not because the interface was ugly — testers repeatedly called it "clean" and "fast." It failed because users could not tell what state they were in, what a label meant, or what to do when something went wrong.',
