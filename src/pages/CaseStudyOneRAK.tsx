      {/* THE HOOK */}
      <div style={{ ...S, paddingTop: 48 }}>
        <h2 style={H2}>The Hook</h2>
        <Body>The regional government wants to be one of the top 10 destinations in the world for ease of doing business — a "single window" where 100% of business inquiries are handled through one coordinated, digital front door. At the start of this engagement, that front door was three separate doors.</Body>
        <Body>Investors and agents navigated the Customer Portal, a separate Agent Portal, and the Secondary Government Portal — three products, three technology stacks (Salesforce Communities Cloud, Salesforce Communities Cloud + Visual Force, and SAP BTP + BLS.NET), and three inconsistent experiences layered onto highly customised, hard-to-change architecture. The secondary portal ran on an MVC architecture that caused response delays, and customers and agents both complained about the design, the terminology, and the amount of manual back-and-forth required to get a licence.</Body>
        <Body>When the engagement team put real users in front of the current portals, the numbers made the business case on their own: across 60 tasks attempted in usability testing, only 63.3% were completed successfully. Not because the interface was ugly — testers repeatedly called it "clean" and "fast." It failed because users could not tell what state they were in, what a label meant, or what to do when something went wrong.</Body>
        <Body>Thirteen months later, OneRAK is live: one unified experience spanning all 18 core services across the three portals, built on a shared Design Language System, and validated end-to-end with the same investors and agents who struggled with the original portals. Task success on the redesigned services now sits at 97.8%, average completion time on the flagship Instant Licence journey has dropped from 32 minutes to 11, and agent calls into internal IT for status chasing are down 82%.</Body>
      </div>

      {/* RESEARCH */}
      <div style={S}>
        <h2 style={H2}>Outlining the Research</h2>
        <Body>Before redesigning a single screen, the team needed a factual account of where the current portals actually break — not assumptions about what "modern government UX" should look like. The Discover phase ran four parallel tracks.</Body>

            <p style={{ fontSize: 15, lineHeight: 1.75, color: '#5A5F73', margin: 0 }}>The team reviewed 50+ existing documents (RFP, process maps, prior audits) and ran 45+ stakeholder interview sessions across the authority's divisions, alongside 3 design vision sessions, 3 full portal walkthroughs, and 4 dedicated agent focus interviews — building a shared, factual picture of business goals, technical constraints, and internal pain points before any design work started.</p>

            <p style={{ fontSize: 15, lineHeight: 1.75, color: '#5A5F73', margin: '0 0 12px' }}>Six users were run through core Customer Portal tasks. Landing on the homepage worked for everyone (6/6); things degraded from there. Choosing between "Open branch" and "Continue journey" confused users who couldn't tell the options apart (5/6 completed). Document upload was worst — only 2 of 6 users completed it, because the spinner gave no filename, no message, and no visible confirmation that anything had happened.</p>
            <p style={{ fontSize: 15, lineHeight: 1.75, color: '#5A5F73', margin: 0 }}>On the secondary government portal, the same pattern repeated at a larger scale across 10 tasks with 6 participants: 83.3% of users found labels hard to read, said there were too many required steps, and said the process simply took too long; only 2 of 6 could tell whether their application had actually gone through.</p>

          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, color: '#5A5F73', margin: 0 }}>Rather than jumping straight to a target-state journey, the team first mapped current-state journeys across the two portals against the high-level requirements each service needed to satisfy. This produced a shared inventory of where each of the 18 in-scope services broke down — licensing and registration, visa processing, renewals, and amendments — with every pain point tied to a specific step of a specific journey, so Design and Build inherited a prioritised, evidence-linked backlog rather than a generic wish list.</p>

          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: '0 0 16px' }}>The research kept surfacing the same root cause in different clothing: three teams solving the same accessibility and clarity problems independently, on incompatible backends, with no shared source of truth for what "good" looked like.</p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: 0 }}>That reframed the brief. The deliverable wasn't three redesigned portals — it was one Design Language System that made every future screen, on any of the three platforms, compliant and consistent by construction. Fixing 18 services was the proof; the DLS is what scales past them.</p>

      {/* DESIGN SYSTEM FIRST */}
      <div style={S}>
        <h2 style={H2}>Design System First</h2>
        <Body>Rather than designing screens directly, the team began by building the OneRAK Design Language System — a Storybook-documented component library covering tokens, atoms, molecules, and organisms — before a single product screen was committed. This decision, made in week three of the engagement, proved commercially critical: it allowed parallel workstreams across three developer teams without visual drift, and reduced design QA cycles by an estimated 40%.</Body>
        <Body>The DLS shipped with 140 components across 4 theme contexts (investor, agent, government internal, mobile), full accessibility annotations, and a governance model covering how new components are proposed, reviewed, and promoted to production.</Body>

        <DarkBox label="Key Design Decision">
          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: '0 0 16px' }}>The most contested design decision was the unified account model — one login, one profile, multiple roles. The technical team initially pushed for separate authenticated experiences per portal. We held the position: a single account with role-switching is not just a UX preference, it's the only architecture that reflects how real investors operate. An agent managing 12 clients doesn't want 12 logins.</p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: 0 }}>User testing at week 8 with 14 representative users confirmed the hypothesis: task completion on the unified model outperformed the separate-portal baseline by 34 percentage points on the first attempt.</p>
