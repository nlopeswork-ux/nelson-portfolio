    hook1: "Every month, 200 third-party retail franchise dealers submit financial data to the client's Record-to-Report managed service — trial balances, account schedules, and supporting documents loaded into Microsoft Business Central. Every month, client analysts manually ingest every file, map every local dealer account code to the client's corporate Chart of Accounts, reconcile discrepancies, investigate anomalies, propose journal entries, and govern what gets posted — against a hard month-end close deadline that waits for no one.",
    hookEmphasis: "The process works. The economics don't.",
    hook2: "At 60–90 minutes of analyst time per franchise per cycle, the engagement consumes up to 300 analyst-hours every single month. The cost of the 200th franchise equals the cost of the first. Nothing compounds. When the client's Mobility division — roughly 10× the current engagement in scale — issued a bid invitation, the engagement team faced a structural problem: winning that contract and delivering it manually would require 10× the headcount. Winning it on a cost basis was not commercially viable.",
    hook3: 'IntelliForge SR2R is an ontology-driven Decision Twin — a governed control layer sitting on top of Business Central — that ingests submissions, maps accounts with confidence scoring, scores close readiness, predicts risk, estimates the cost of inaction, generates intervention plans, automates governed journal entries, and maintains a complete, reproducible audit trail.
