        <h2 style={H2}>The Hook</h2>
        <Body>By 2023, the design team had accumulated three years of project-specific component libraries, each built in isolation, each solving the same problems differently. A button in one engagement looked nothing like a button in another. A data table in one project shared no structure with the same pattern elsewhere. Every new engagement started from scratch, rebuilding foundations the team had built — and rebuilt — many times before.</Body>
        <Body>The cost was invisible in any single project but enormous in aggregate: an estimated 30–40% of designer time on every engagement was spent rebuilding components that already existed somewhere in the team's Figma library history, but couldn't be safely reused because their quality, accessibility, and documentation were inconsistent.</Body>

It's what happens in month 8, when a designer on a fast-moving engagement needs a pattern the system doesn't have, the deadline is in three days, and the temptation to build it one-off is real.</p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: 0 }}>The RFC process was designed specifically for this moment: a lightweight proposal (one page, five fields) that can be reviewed asynchronously in 24 hours, approved for one-off use with a flag to be properly componentised in the next system sprint, or promoted directly to the backlog with a two-week SLA. It's the difference between a system that calcifies and one that grows.</p>

        <Body>The roadmap was sequenced, not just scheduled: senior capacity was deliberately run near its ceiling (81–89% utilization) on the highest-risk phases — base components and structural templates — while junior capacity was held in reserve to absorb corrections without slipping the timeline. Token work was sequenced ahead of every component tier on purpose: building components against ungoverned values would have meant redoing Tier 1 once tokens were finalized.</Body>

        <Body>By the close of Phase 1, the system had moved past pilot status: adopted across 2+ live projects spanning different industries and geographies, each validating the core/project-layer split against a real, non-hypothetical brief — not just a heavier design file.</Body>

        <Body>Led the UX/UI direction for the initiative and acted as the technical bridge between UX/UI, front-end, backend and the PM — the design system only holds together if those four perspectives agree on the same constraints. Also provided hands-on technical support to junior UX/UI designers working within the system, reviewing their component contributions and helping them reason through edge cases rather than just approving or rejecting.</Body>

        <Body>Not every gap closed in Phase 1. Two functional modules (onboarding flows, search behavior) were reconstructed from observed patterns rather than re-validated against the original design teams — a known trade-off, flagged for confirmation before being treated as ground truth.</Body>

        <h2 style={H2}>Phase 2 — From Documentation to Agentic-Ready</h2>
        <Body>I made the bet that documentation structured for machine parsing would outlast documentation structured for human reading habits — before an agent was actually the reader. A design system written for a human designer optimises for prose — a usage guide, a rationale paragraph, a "when not to use" note read once and internalised. None of that is reliably parseable by a generative AI agent trying to decide, at runtime, which component to reach for and which prop values are actually valid. Phase 2 restructures the same underlying platform — the same tokens, the same tiered component library, the same governance model — so its documentation is structured enough for an agent to read it correctly, not just a person.</Body>
        <Body>That meant moving component specs from narrative documentation toward explicit, structured metadata: enumerated props and variants, machine-readable naming conventions, and example-driven usage patterns an agent can pattern-match against, on top of the human-readable guide that stays for designers.</Body>
