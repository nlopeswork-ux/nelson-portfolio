        <Body>From year one, the design team built and maintained a component library in Figma — initially for internal consistency, later extended to OutSystems-ready components that developers could implement directly. By Phase 2, the component library covered 90+ components across light and dark themes, with Arabic RTL variants for every pattern introduced in Phase 3.</Body>

          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: '0 0 16px' }}>Taking the Design Lead role in 2024 meant moving from delivery to governance: running weekly design reviews, establishing a decision log for every significant UX decision (rationale, alternatives considered, who approved), and mentoring a junior designer joining the engagement mid-programme.</p>
          <p style={{ fontSize: 16, lineHeight: 1.75, margin: 0 }}>The most significant structural change: implementing a shared definition of "design done" — a checklist covering accessibility, RTL, dark mode, error states, and empty states — that every screen had to pass before entering development. It added two days to design cycles and eliminated an entire category of late-stage development rework.</p>
